# TimeWeb
My time travel experiment archive website.
Purpose:
This is a repository for the HTML files where I store and publish the results of my attempts to contact time-travelers.
General Method:
For time 1.0 and 2.0 I manually generated information and invited time-travelers/prognosticators to send me the information before it had been generated in order to prove their abilities. For time 3.0, I set up a bot to automatically generate the information in an array of 12 numbers. The results of each of the experiments are stored and published on my personal website. Time travelers are invited to send me any advance results on twitter.
