    <h1>Bridgett's Time Travel Experimental Archive</h1>
    <p>On June 23, 2018, I issued the first of a series of invitations for time-travelers to make contact with me. In my first experiment, I asked time-travelers to meet me in person and present a verbal password as verification. However, to keep the experiment clear from hoax, I required that the time-traveler already know the password I would give them as verification that they were from the future. This, obviously, created a paradox, so in my next set of experiments, I asked for time-travelers or anyone with future information to send me the results of dice rolls before I made them on a pre-scheduled date and time. </p>
    <p>I ran the experiment for a few weeks and then declared it a failure. Then, on examining the first set of experiments, I found several issues with the experimental design, so I sent a second series of invitations for time-travelers to send me the results of die rolls, this time having the rolls blinded, using a dice tower, and pre-committing to the number of dice rolled, constraining the probability of a lucky guess. </p>
    <p>I invited the time-travelers to contact me on <a href="https://projectdxm.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">my website </a>, or on Twitter<a href="https://twitter.com/bkkawaii" target="_blank"> @bkkawaii</a> with the dice roll results before the rolls were made. I am archiving the results of both sets of experimental results below for posterity and for the eyes of potential future time-travelers. </p>
    <h2>Time 1.0 Results</h2>
    <p> Below are the results of my first series of dice rolls. A variety of different-sided dice were used in this course of experiments.</p>
